                When I was 13, I had my first love
                There was nobody that compared to my baby
                And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
                She had me goin' crazy
                Oh, I was starstruck
                She woke me up daily
                Don't need no Starbucks (woo)

                She made my heart pound
                And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
                At school on the playground
                But I really wanna see her on the weekend
                She knows she got me dazin'
                'Cause she was so amazin'
                And now, my heart is breakin'
                But I just keep on sayin'
